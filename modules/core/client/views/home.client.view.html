    <h2>PARTICULARS</h2>

    <h4> There is a massive growth in the use of smart phones (especially Android phones) over the past few years.
      Cities play a major role in the economic development of the nation. But still the City Corporation, major
      government and non-government bodies are using the old method of publishing the notifications about various social
      events, cultural events, campaigns and important dates in the newspapers. But due to the busy life style of people
      they are unable to go through the published notifications. Also it is time consuming procedure for a person to
      post a complaint to various government departments. All these practices are time consuming perhaps time is the
      most important factor today.
